Thank you for giving me the opportunity.
I learn many new things by this test assignment 

I create this assignment as clear as possible using MVP architecture.Also created utiles class and constant class any developer can understand code fast and easy way. 

There are some point remains like past fragment argument default. I try to cover possible functionality. 

I also write one test case for DateUtilTest class and trying to write test case from UtilsTest but getting some error. 

I also create a JavaDoc file for fast code review for other peoples and code coverage reports. For now, the code coverage report is showing 0% because not write more test cases. 

If you like any implement in this assigment. Please just inform me. I will update it and again send it for review.

Thank you
